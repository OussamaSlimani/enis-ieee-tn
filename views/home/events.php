This event has been an initiative to bring students together in the glorious month of Ramadan to enjoy each other's company in this religious month. This occasion has helped merge the usually annual Iftar coinciding with Jupiter sighting and the IEEE ENIS Student Branch 15th founding day. This in turn allowed for many students to attend both from the ENIS Student Branch and other Student Branches. The event has had great success, including a shared dinner, team-building activities, a stargazing/aerospace session, networking, and finally the blowing of the candles, marking another year of excellence for the IEEE ENIS Student Branch.",

          "description" => "The IEEE Computer Society Chapter ENIS SB recently hosted HELLO WORLD! 4.0, building on the success of previous editions with an even more impactful event. Over 160 participants, both IEEE members and non-members, gathered to engage in workshops and a competitive programming competition aimed at sharpening problem-solving skills.

The event began with a welcoming ceremony, followed by an inspiring live call with the Ebsilong Team ; top-ranking computer science students from ISI Ariana, including Saif Khelil, Yassine Hajji, Med Aziz Smiri, and Aziz Bel Haj Amor. Known for their impressive achievements, the Ebsilong Team holds Rank 1 in TCPC for two consecutive years, Rank 11 in ACPC 2023, and they made history by winning Tunisia's first-ever medal in the ACPC. They shared insights into their journey, inspiring participants with their dedication and problem-solving strategies.

The technical aspect kicked off with a session led by the scientific team (professors) to introduce Codeforces as the competition platform, ensuring all participants could access and navigate it effectively. This familiarization session allowed everyone to feel confident using the platform and helped create a smooth and focused competition environment.

Following a lunch break, the competition commenced on Codeforces and lasted for three hours. Participants enjoyed a dynamic and motivating setting where every solved problem was celebrated with balloons, adding to the excitement and fostering a spirit of achievement.

In the end, three winners were awarded prizes of 600 D, 400 D, and 300 D, with an additional prize for the Best Ambassador for exceptional contributions.

HELLO WORLD! 4.0 had a meaningful impact. It encouraged participants to develop essential problem-solving skills that are invaluable in todayâ€™s tech industry. Non-IEEE members, including those from competitive programming clubs, were impressed by the technical and supportive environment and expressed interest in joining the IEEE community to further enhance their skills. This event not only celebrated success but also ignited a passion for competitive programming and technical growth within our community.
